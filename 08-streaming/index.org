* Introduction
   Programming with streams is also called functional reactive programming
   (FRP). It is one (of many) ways of handling state in a way that is compatible
   with referential transparency; which is basically the isolation of side
   effects, or making sure changes to program state happen in a way that is not
   noticed by different sections of the code.

#+REVEAL: split

   Streams make forefront the concerns of functional (immutability) and reactive
   (inversion of control) aspects of programming.

   When working with Streams, one is able to describe time itself in the code
   you write. There are two ways to model time in FRP, either discretely (in
   steps) or continuously.

   In a discrete view $(t_1, v_1) \rightarrow (t_2, v_2) \dashrightarrow (t_n,
   v_n)$ you can think of a stream as a endless list of values that happen at
   arbitrary moments in time: $v_1, v_2, \ldots v_n$.

* Explanation

   The key insight is that you can map changes of a property though time as a
   list of these values as a way to regain composability around event /streams/.

   There are then two distinct concepts that arise (we will use the BaconJS
   terminology from now on) ~Properties~ and ~EventStreams~.

#+REVEAL: split

   In a ~property~, you can always ask: =What is property's value now?= or a
   ~property~ is expected to hold a value at any given moment in time.

   An ~eventStreams~ on the other hand does not hold on to values across time,
   they are ephemeral and only send out signals (or events) as they are
   triggered.

#+REVEAL: split

   Key combinators arise:

   (we can visualize them at https://rxmarbles.com/)

#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   * ~filter~ : Only consider (emit) values if they match the filter predicate
   * ~map~ : Transform all values applying a given function to each value
     individually.
   * ~take~ : Close a stream after taking the first *n* elements from it.
   * ~concat~ : Concatenate a second stream right at the end of a first one.
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   * ~skipUntil~ : Ignore (do not emit) values until they match a given
     predicate; then continue unconditionally.
   * ~debounce~ : Only emit the last value from a noisy bunch.
#+REVEAL: split
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   * ~concatMap~ : flatten / unroll internal streams via the ~concat~ function.
   * ~mergeMap~ : flatten / unroll internal streams via the ~merge~ function.
   * ~switchMap~ : flatten / unroll internal streams by canceling on every new
     value emission to the parent.

* Examples
   Starting point: https://jsfiddle.net/kryptt/y5fta1nc/
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (fade-in)
   1. Switch and light.
   2. Ensure the bulb shuts down after 2 seconds of inactivity.
   3. Turn the light on when the mouse enters the box and off when it leaves it.

* Exercises
   Pick one or more of:
   1. Write a login/logout module that holds the current user as a ~Property~.
      Store logins and passwords for validation in memory.
   2. Write a drawing application over a HTML5 Canvas. Store the current color
      and brush width in a property.
   3. Write a stock market tracker.
