* "Correct Software"

  What does it mean for software to be "correct"?

  There are three main criteria:
  + Independently verifiable evidence.
  + Continue to function for *all* possible input.
  + Do nothing else.

** Whitebox programming

  + Dijkstra (1970)) "Notes On Structured Programming" :: "A convincing demonstration of correctness being impossible as long as the mechanism is regarded as a black box, our only hope is in not regarding the mechanism as a black box"

  Use types to shed light into your assertions and invariants. Doing so makes your compiler a proof assistant.
